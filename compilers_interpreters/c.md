### **1. Is RPython Python written in Python?**
   - **RPython (Restricted Python)** is **not exactly Python**, but a subset of Python.
   - It is designed to **be statically analyzable**, meaning it can be **compiled** into C code.
   - **PyPy is implemented in RPython** and can translate itself into C, removing the need for an interpreter.
   - **RPython acts as an intermediate step** between Python and compiled languages.

---

### **2. Did PyPy need a bootstrap compiler or interpreter?**
   - Yes, **a bootstrap was needed**.
   - Since PyPy is written in RPython (a subset of Python), it **could not directly run itself**.
   - The **first version was written in Python and executed using CPython**.
   - Then, **a translation tool compiled RPython code into C**, which was then compiled into a native executable.
   - After this step, PyPy could be used to **run itself** and improve over time.

### **3. Diagram: How Python (CPython & PyPy) Work**
Here is a diagram to make things clearer:

```
[ Python Source Code ]
        â†“
[ CPython Interpreter ]       [ PyPy (RPython) ]
        â†“                              â†“
[ CPython Bytecode ]            [ RPython Translator ]
        â†“                              â†“
[ CPython Virtual Machine ]   [ C Code (Generated) ]
        â†“                              â†“
[ Executed on CPU ]            [ Compiled to Native Executable ]
```

- **CPython interprets Python source code into bytecode**, then runs it on a Python Virtual Machine.
- **PyPy translates RPython into C, compiles it, and runs the compiled version**, making it faster.

### **4. Bootstrap Compilers: How Was the First C Compiler Made?**
The **first C compiler couldn't be written in C**, because no C compiler existed yet. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:

1. **Step 1: A lower-level language (BASIC, Assembly, or another language) was used to write the first C compiler.**
   - Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson used **B (a simplified version of BCPL)** to write an early version of C.

2. **Step 2: The first version of the C compiler was compiled into machine code using an existing assembler.**
   - This allowed C code to be translated into assembly.

3. **Step 3: Once the first C compiler was compiled, it was used to rewrite itself in C.**
   - This is called **self-hosting**.
   - The **intermediate step (B language) was removed**.

### **5. Diagram: How C Became Self-Hosting**
```
[ B (or Assembly) Compiler ] ---> [ First C Compiler (written in B) ] ---> [ C Compiler (written in C) ]
                â†“                                    â†“                                    â†“
      [ Machine Code ]             [ Compiled C Code ]              [ Final C Compiler ]
```

- **The first C compiler was not written in C.**
- **After it was compiled, C could be used to write its own compiler.**
- **Now, all modern C compilers are written in C!**

---

### **6. Summary**
- **RPython is a subset of Python**, designed for static analysis.
- **PyPy needed CPython to bootstrap itself**, then translated itself to C.
- **The first C compiler was written in a simpler language (B)**, then rewritten in C.
- **Modern compilers are self-hosting**, meaning **they are written in the language they compile**.

Would you like to try a simple bootstrap example, like writing an interpreter for a mini-language? ðŸš€
