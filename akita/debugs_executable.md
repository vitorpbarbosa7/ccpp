Since you're on **macOS ARM M1**, your executable is not an **ELF** (Executable and Linkable Format) file. Instead, macOS uses **Mach-O** (Mach Object File Format) for executables, dynamic libraries, and object files.

---

### **1. Check the Executable Format**
To verify the format of your executable, run:
```sh
file your_executable
```
Example output on macOS:
```
your_executable: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
```
This confirms that it's a **Mach-O** binary for ARM64.

---

### **2. View Mach-O Headers (Equivalent to ELF Headers)**
To inspect the Mach-O structure, use:
```sh
otool -h your_executable
```
This prints the Mach-O **header**, similar to `readelf -h` on Linux.

If you need more detailed information:
```sh
otool -l your_executable
```
This shows **load commands**, segment mappings, and more.

---

### **3. List Dynamic Libraries (Equivalent to ldd)**
To check shared libraries used by your binary:
```sh
otool -L your_executable
```
This is similar to `ldd` on Linux.

---

### **4. Dump Raw Assembly (Equivalent to objdump -d)**
To disassemble the binary:
```sh
otool -tV your_executable
```
This prints the **assembly instructions**.

For more detailed disassembly:
```sh
llvm-objdump -d your_executable
```
This works if you have LLVM installed via Homebrew:
```sh
brew install llvm
```

---

### **5. Inspect Symbols (Equivalent to nm)**
To list symbols in the binary:
```sh
nm -gU your_executable
```
- `-g` ‚Üí Show only **global symbols**.
- `-U` ‚Üí **Do not show undefined symbols**.

To show **all** symbols:
```sh
nm your_executable
```

---

### **6. Debug the Executable**
To debug your Mach-O binary, use **LLDB** (the macOS alternative to GDB):
```sh
lldb your_executable
```
Inside LLDB, start debugging with:
```lldb
run
```
To set a breakpoint:
```lldb
breakpoint set --name main
```
To step through execution:
```lldb
step
```

---

### **7. Hexdump the Binary (Raw Inspection)**
If you want to inspect the raw **hexadecimal representation** of your binary:
```sh
xxd your_executable | less
```
Or dump it to a file:
```sh
xxd your_executable > binary_dump.txt
```

---

### **Summary of Key Commands**
| Action | Command |

| Check executable type | `file your_executable` |
| View Mach-O headers | `otool -h your_executable` |
| View Mach-O load commands | `otool -l your_executable` |
| List shared libraries | `otool -L your_executable` |
| Disassemble binary | `otool -tV your_executable` |
| Dump detailed disassembly | `llvm-objdump -d your_executable` |
| List symbols | `nm -gU your_executable` |
| Debug binary | `lldb your_executable` |
| Hexdump | `xxd your_executable | less` |
