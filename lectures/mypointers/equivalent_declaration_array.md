Yes, both of these code examples are **equivalent** in terms of functionality. Here's why:

### 1. **Array vs Pointer in Function Signature**:
In C, when you declare a parameter as `int *arr` or `int arr[]`, they are treated in the same way. Both are interpreted as a **pointer to the first element of an array**. In fact, when an array is passed to a function, it decays into a pointer to the first element.

- **`int *arr`**: This explicitly declares `arr` as a pointer to an integer. It can be used to access the array elements using pointer arithmetic or array indexing.
- **`int arr[]`**: This is a shorthand that also declares `arr` as a pointer to the first element of the array. This is equivalent to `int *arr` when used in a function parameter.

So in both of your examples, whether you write `int *arr` or `int arr[]` in the function signature, **both versions are the same** from a technical perspective. The **array decays to a pointer** when passed to the function.

### 2. **Function Behavior**:
The behavior of the function `arrayprint` will be identical in both cases because `arr` will point to the first element of the array in both cases. The rest of the function accesses the array in the same way using array indexing (`arr[i]`).

### 3. **Memory and Access**:
- When you pass an array to a function in C, the **array decays into a pointer to the first element**, so the array itself is not passed by value (it's passed by reference). The memory for the array remains the same; only the pointer is passed to the function.

### Conclusion:
Both **`int *arr`** and **`int arr[]`** in the function signature behave the same way when used as parameters, and the program will **function identically** in both cases. Therefore, both code examples are equivalent.

#### Summary:
- **`int *arr`** and **`int arr[]`** are equivalent when used in function parameters.
- In both examples, `arr[i]` will access the `i`th element of the array correctly.
- The output will be the same in both cases.
