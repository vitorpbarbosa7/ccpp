Yes, when you run a command like `gcc main.c answer.c -o main`, the **GCC compiler** performs a series of steps to convert your C code into an executable. Let's break this down step by step, including what files are generated and how the **linker** works with them.

### 1. **Preprocessing**:
   - The **preprocessor** handles directives like `#include`, `#define`, `#if`, and other macros.
   - It expands the `#include` files (header files) and processes any macros (`#define`).
   - **Output**: The preprocessed code is saved in an intermediate file (usually `.i`).
   
   Command for preprocessing only:
   ```bash
   gcc -E main.c -o main.i
   ```
   
   **Result**: A file `main.i` that contains the C source code after all the preprocessor directives have been processed.

### 2. **Compilation** (from C to Assembly):
   - The **compiler** takes the preprocessed C code (from the previous step) and compiles it into assembly code. This step also performs syntax checking, optimizations, and other transformations.
   - **Output**: The assembly code is generated and saved as `.s` file.
   
   Command for generating the assembly code:
   ```bash
   gcc -S main.c -o main.s
   ```
   
   **Result**: A file `main.s` that contains the assembly code for your platform.

### 3. **Assembly** (from Assembly to Object Code):
   - The **assembler** takes the assembly code (`main.s`) and converts it into machine code (binary format) for your specific architecture. This machine code is in the form of an **object file**.
   - **Output**: The object file is saved with a `.o` extension.
   
   Command for assembling:
   ```bash
   gcc -c main.c -o main.o
   ```
   
   **Result**: A file `main.o` that contains the machine code for the `main.c` source file. Similarly, the `answer.c` file would also be compiled into `answer.o` at this stage:
   ```bash
   gcc -c answer.c -o answer.o
   ```

### 4. **Linking** (Combining Object Files into an Executable):
   - The **linker** takes the object files (e.g., `main.o` and `answer.o`) and combines them into a single executable.
   - The linker resolves symbols (like function calls) and fixes the addresses where the functions are located in the final executable.
   - **Output**: The final executable file is generated (in this case, `main`).
   
   Command for linking:
   ```bash
   gcc main.o answer.o -o main
   ```
   
   **Result**: The final executable file `main` is produced. This executable is ready to run.

### So, to answer your questions:

1. **Is there an assembly file in the middle?**
   - Yes, there is an assembly file (`main.s`) that is generated after the compilation step. It represents the code in a human-readable assembly language format. However, you don’t always see it, as it’s typically an intermediate step used by the compiler.

2. **Does the linker work with object files?**
   - Yes, the linker works with the **object files** (`main.o` and `answer.o`). These object files contain machine code, and the linker combines them into a final executable.

3. **If the object files are binary machine code, how does the linker handle this?**
   - Even though object files contain machine code, they still contain additional information (called **symbol tables** and **relocation information**) that tells the linker how to combine them. The linker uses this metadata to connect the functions and variables from different object files and resolve any addresses, so the final executable can be run.

   - The object files are not just raw machine code; they contain a structure with the necessary information to link them together correctly. This is why the linker can still combine them, despite their binary format.

### Full Compilation Process Breakdown (for `gcc main.c answer.c -o main`):

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Command: `gcc -E main.c`
   - Output: `main.i` (preprocessed code).

2. **Compilation**:
   - Command: `gcc -S main.c`
   - Output: `main.s` (assembly code).

3. **Assembly**:
   - Command: `gcc -c main.c`
   - Output: `main.o` (object file for `main.c`).

4. **Linking**:
   - Command: `gcc main.o answer.o -o main`
   - Output: `main` (final executable).

### Example:

Let’s say you run this full command:
```bash
gcc main.c answer.c -o main
```

- **Step 1**: `main.c` and `answer.c` are preprocessed into `main.i` and `answer.i`.
- **Step 2**: The compiler turns `main.i` and `answer.i` into `main.s` and `answer.s` (assembly).
- **Step 3**: The assembler converts `main.s` and `answer.s` into `main.o` and `answer.o` (object files).
- **Step 4**: The linker takes `main.o` and `answer.o`, resolves any symbols, and creates the final executable `main`.

By breaking down these steps, you get a clearer view of what happens during the compilation process, and how the linker is able to handle object files despite their binary nature.
