### Explanation of What Happened:

In the output you provided, the key thing to notice is that `string1` and `string2` point to **different memory locations**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Memory Allocation**:
   - `string1 = (char*) malloc(16);` allocates **16 bytes** of memory.
   - Then, `strcpy(string1, "0123456789AB");` copies `"0123456789AB"` (12 characters + 1 NUL terminator) into `string1`. So, `string1` should hold the string `"0123456789AB"` in the first 13 bytes of the allocated 16-byte space.

2. **Reallocation**:
   - `string2 = realloc(string1, 64);` attempts to reallocate the memory. Specifically:
     - **`realloc`** tries to resize the memory block to **64 bytes**.
     - If there is enough contiguous free memory, it will **resize the block in place**. However, if the memory cannot be resized in the same location (for example, if there is not enough space next to the original block), `realloc` will **move the memory** to a new location.
   
   In your case, it seems that `realloc` **moved the memory block** to a new address because `string1` and `string2` are pointing to different addresses (`0x600003c40010` vs. `0x600002b4c000`). The original memory allocated to `string1` was **not reused** after the reallocation.

3. **Output Values**:
   - **`string1 Value: 0x600003c40010 [0x600003c40010]`**: This output shows the old address (`0x600003c40010`) where `string1` used to point before `realloc`. After the reallocation, this pointer became invalid, and the contents of the memory block might be corrupted (hence the weird value `[value]`).
   - **`string2 Value: 0x600002b4c000 [0123456789AB]`**: `string2` now points to the new memory location (`0x600002b4c000`), and the string data `"0123456789AB"` was successfully copied to this new location. The data is intact, but it's now located at the new address.

### Key Points:
- `realloc` may **move the memory** to a new location if it cannot expand the original block in place.
- After `realloc`, the **old pointer (`string1`)** might still point to the old memory address, but that memory is now invalid because it has been reallocated elsewhere. So, the value at `string1` may seem invalid or garbage.
- The **new pointer (`string2`)** points to the newly allocated block, and the data is preserved at the new address.

### Why Different Memory Locations?
- **Memory Fragmentation**: The heap is divided into blocks of free and used memory. If thereâ€™s not enough contiguous free space to expand the original block, `realloc` will allocate a new block elsewhere, copy the old data to the new location, and free the old memory.
- **Pointer Safety**: After calling `realloc`, the old pointer (`string1`) is no longer valid, even though it still holds the old address. The **new pointer (`string2`)** should always be used to access the newly allocated memory after `realloc`.

### Conclusion:
- Always use the pointer returned by `realloc` (`string2` in this case) because the original pointer (`string1`) may now point to invalid memory. 
- Never dereference a pointer after calling `realloc` on it unless you know it still points to valid memory.
