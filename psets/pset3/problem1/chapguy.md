Your solution looks great! You have correctly modified the code to:

1. **Use dynamic memory allocation** (`malloc`) for the array in the `main()` function.
2. **Passed the array by reference** to the `sort` function.
3. **Implemented the insertion sort logic** using pointer arithmetic and correctly placed the key element in its sorted position.
4. **Freed the memory** allocated for the array with `free(array)` and set it to `NULL` to avoid potential issues with dangling pointers.

### Here are a few points to consider or improve upon:

1. **Input Size (`n`)**:
   - You hardcoded `n = 10` in the `main()` function instead of allowing the user to input the size. It seems you found the input part a bit boring, but it would be more flexible to let the user choose the size. You can uncomment and use the following part if you want to allow user input:
   ```c
   printf("Enter the number of elements: ");
   scanf("%d", &n);
   ```

2. **Memory Allocation Check**:
   - After allocating memory with `malloc`, itâ€™s a good practice to check if the allocation was successful (i.e., the pointer is not `NULL`). This will help avoid potential issues if `malloc` fails to allocate memory.
   ```c
   if (array == NULL) {
       printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
       return 1;
   }
   ```

3. **Pointer Arithmetic and `key`**:
   - Your implementation of using pointer arithmetic in the `sort` function is correct. However, instead of using `*(A + i)` and `*(A + j)`, you could use the array indexing notation `A[i]` and `A[j]` for better readability. Both methods work the same, but array indexing is more intuitive and widely used.

   Example:
   ```c
   key = A[i];  // instead of key = *(A + i);
   while (A[j] > key && j >= 0) {  // instead of *(A + j)
   ```

   This would make the code slightly more readable, but your pointer approach works as well, so this is just a matter of preference.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - **Insertion Sort** has a worst-case time complexity of **O(n^2)**, which is fine for smaller arrays. However, for large arrays, this might not be the most efficient algorithm. You could consider using a more efficient algorithm like **Quick Sort** or **Merge Sort** for larger datasets, but for small arrays (like your current use case with `n=10`), Insertion Sort is perfectly acceptable.

5. **Memory Leak**:
   - You already correctly call `free(array)` at the end of `main()` to release the dynamically allocated memory, which is great! The memory is then set to `NULL`, which helps to avoid potential issues with dangling pointers.

### Final Thoughts:

Your solution is **correct and functional**. You correctly implemented dynamic memory allocation, the sorting algorithm, and proper memory management. The changes you made (like hardcoding the input size and using pointer arithmetic) don't affect the core functionality, but making it more flexible for user input and checking for memory allocation success could make the code more robust.

Nice work!
